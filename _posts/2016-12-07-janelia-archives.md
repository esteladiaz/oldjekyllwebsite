In celebration of Janelia's 10th anniversary, our team sought items, breakthroughs, and achievements that stand out in the years since Janelia's 2006 opening.

I created social media for this, found at Janelia's [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HHMIJRC/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hhmijanelia/), and [twitter](https://twitter.com/HHMIJanelia).

See the completed project at [Janelia.org](https://www.janelia.org/janelia-archives).
