In 2011, I was part of a small freelance group in Davis, California, that helped local businesses set up their online presences. One of these businesses was [The Candy House of Davis](http://www.candyhouseofdavis.com/).

I edited many of their product images using Adobe Photoshop, improving their presentation. Of the images I edited over five years ago, many are still in use [here](http://www.candyhouseofdavis.com/chocolate-truffles).
